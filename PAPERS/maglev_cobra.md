"The results shows that the energy that could be regenerated by braking is around 24.5% of the total consumed by the vehicle"

THE TRACTION OF A MAGLEV VEHICLE](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Regenerative-braking-of-a-linear-induction-motor-of-Oliveira-Mattos/02bb93b73b95d6c048b31e33c82419530251f0ef)

Conclusions: 
- system with more stored kinetic energy do not necessarily regenerate more energy during braking. 
- the ability to harness this energy depends on the motor deceleration profile
- the analysis in Section VIII demonstrates that the maximal energy regeneration is given by (15), in other words, by decreasing the supply frequency in controlled steps of half the operational velocity.
- The energy generated in the system can be returned to the grid, stored in a device or directly used by motor or load. A benefit of direct use is to reduce conversion losses and dispense auxiliary circuits.
