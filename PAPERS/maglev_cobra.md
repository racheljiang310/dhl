[Designing a Regenerative Braking and Energy Storage System for the Superconducting MaglevCobra Vehicle](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Designing-a-Regenerative-Braking-and-Energy-Storage-Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Sousa/9dde1d1a939d8779840a62c89d4b5b93b198be09)

"The results shows that the energy that could be regenerated by braking is around 24.5% of the total consumed by the vehicle"
* "scenario expectable in a peak hour of utilization"
* "regenerative braking can be performed, but only a small amount of energy could be recovered due to the low efficiency of the traction system when braking."
* "Due the lightweight characteristics of the vehicle it is possible to design an energy storage system capable of power the whole vehicle operation, becoming an electric autonomous vehicle"

Details: Length: 200 meters, friction force: μ

Phase 1: Uniform Acceleration
- Trust Force = M * a + μ * M * g
Phase 2: Constant Speed (cruising)
- Trust Force = μ * M * g
Phase 3: Uniform Deceleration
- Trust Force = -μ * M * g - M * a

Work needed to move train: $W = \int (F_{trust} \times v)dt$
- Notes:
  - since we have lighter mass, and friction constant is lower, means < Work to move carts
  - they also take into account auxilary electrical componenets (light, screen, motor door, hydraulic systems ~ 76.53 WH Total Energy)

Energy Storage System Technologies
A. Battery: Lithium batteries: 200Wh/kg, power density 10kW/Kg
  - Lithium iron phosphate, Lithium magnesium, lithium titanate => they tested with Option 1
B. Supercapacitors
  - power density: 5-10kW/kg, can with stand high current peak from regenerative breaking/acceleration
  - disads: low nominal voltage, > # cells in series => overvoltage and cell monitoring under high current

Factors: Wieght, Performance, Cost
1. Hybrid -energy storage system (batteries & supercapacitors)

[REGENERATIVE BRAKING OF A LINEAR INDUCTION MOTOR USED FOR
THE TRACTION OF A MAGLEV VEHICLE](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Regenerative-braking-of-a-linear-induction-motor-of-Oliveira-Mattos/02bb93b73b95d6c048b31e33c82419530251f0ef)

Conclusions: 
- system with more stored kinetic energy do not necessarily regenerate more energy during braking. 
- the ability to harness this energy depends on the motor deceleration profile
- the analysis in Section VIII demonstrates that the maximal energy regeneration is given by (15), in other words, by decreasing the supply frequency in controlled steps of half the operational velocity.
- The energy generated in the system can be returned to the grid, stored in a device or directly used by motor or load. A benefit of direct use is to reduce conversion losses and dispense auxiliary circuits.
