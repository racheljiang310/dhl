# Maglev Cobra in Brazil

## [Designing a Regenerative Braking and Energy Storage System for the Superconducting MaglevCobra Vehicle](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Designing-a-Regenerative-Braking-and-Energy-Storage-Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Sousa/9dde1d1a939d8779840a62c89d4b5b93b198be09)

"The results shows that the energy that could be regenerated by braking is around 24.5% of the total consumed by the vehicle"

Conclusions: 
- system with more stored kinetic energy do not necessarily regenerate more energy during braking. 
- the ability to harness this energy depends on the motor deceleration profile
