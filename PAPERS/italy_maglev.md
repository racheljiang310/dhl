## [Energy storage systems to exploit regenerative braking in DC railway systems: Different approaches to improve efficiency of modern high-speed trains](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X17304140)

"Stationary/Infrastructure based Storage Systems. Main advantage is to avoid limitation regarding encumbrances. Main drawback regards additional losses, since energy flows move from the trains to the storage passing through the feeding line... Considering different storage technologies i.e. lithium batteries [11,12] or supercapacitors [13,14]. Energy storage systems are chosen and sized by considering their performance, aging and costeffectiveness"

"On the other hand, reduced number of braking phases and extended railway lines may reduce the costeffectiveness of the proposed solution, as confirmed by the low achieved interest, although today ever increasing"

Considered high-speed train: Italian ETR 1000, a train equipped with a distributed traction system and able to operate both under DC and AC electrifications, thus being able to operate within the main European high-speed lines
- "More in detail, the 57% of the full amount of energy is converted in kinetic energy. Around 10% of energy is dissipated on the contact line, while electric drive losses and auxiliary loads spend, respectively, 18% and 4% respectively. Finally, 11% is adsorbed by motion resistance. It is particularly noticeable that large part of the supplied energy goes into trainsâ€™ kinetic energy, which is not yet lost and can be recovered during future braking actions."

To enhance energy recovery during braking...several variants of storage systems can be considered:

1) Stationary systems, interfaced with the feeding line by means of DC/DC converters:
- Systems based on supercapacitors.
- Systems based on high power lithium batteries.

"The analysis has shown that braking energy recovery is able to provide significant energy and costs saving even in DC high-speed railway systems, opening new research opportunities for the future...It has been verified that supercapacitors, mainly because of the high energy-to-power ratio of this application, cannot compete in terms of costeffectiveness."
