# Research Paper: Conceptual Feasibility Study of the Hyperloop Vehicle for Next-Generation Transport

## Organization: NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH

---

### Summary: 

---

___This study evaluates the conceptual feasibility of the Hyperloop vehicle as a next-generation transportation system, analyzing its design, engineering challenges, and potential viability. It explores key factors such as aerodynamics, propulsion, and infrastructure to assess the practicality of implementing the technology.___

### Definitions:

----

**The Hyperloop**
> new commercial transportation concept designed to offer both shorter travel times and lower ticket costs for short-haul routes.

> vehicle will not expend extra energy climbing/descending from a cruising altitude

> drag reduced flying through a low-pressure tube

> wings are replaced by alternative types of lifting bodies (e.g. magnetic and ground effect technologies)

> previous work: Magneplane, Maglifter, TBC

### Notes:

---

OpenMDAO:  perform sensitivity analyses and trade studies appropriate for evaluating the merit of the concept

#### Model
1. Mission velocity profile: acceleration, coasting with periodic boosting, and deceleration
    -  acceleration: increment acceleration vs constant => negligable energy expenditure diff
    -  coasting:  electromagnetic boosting section throughout track
    -  deceleration: assumes no regen breaks, but it's possible if we wanted to
  
2.  passive system is advantageous because it requires zero power input for levitation to occur at a given speed
3.  Linear synchronous motors (LSMs): propel movement

#### Tube Pressure
1.  lower pressure > the power required of the vacuum system to pump the tube down & maintain tube pressure for a given leakage rate
2.  higher pressure > the density of the air, > the power requirements of electromagnetic propulsion system and the onboard compressor

#### Leakage
- leakage rate due to diffusion & permeation is proportional to the tube surface area
- air introduced into the system during passenger boarding is proportional to the frequency at which pods leave the station

#### Conclusions

- underwater routes could have a significantly lower materials cost due to a more favorable loading conditions generated by buoyancy
- energy usage from this system is of the same order of magnitude as the energy required to propel the passenger pod
- < tube pressure, > energy needed to propel the pod drops but energy required to maintain the vacuum >
- there exists an optimal tube operating pressure that is heavily dependent on the leakage rate. > leakage rate => > optimal tube operating pressure becomes
- **net energy usage is found to be relatively insensitive to pod length**
