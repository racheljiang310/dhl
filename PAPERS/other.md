## [Positive Rail Voltage Rise Behavior and Inhibition Analysis of Regenerative Braking of Mediumâ€“Low-Speed Maglev Train](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379675421_Positive_Rail_Voltage_Rise_Behavior_and_Inhibition_Analysis_of_Regenerative_Braking_of_Medium-Low-Speed_Maglev_Train)

"The current treatment method targeted for the MLS maglev is to release the excess RB energy in the form of heat energy via a ground resistance absorption device, but it results in energy waste and increases the temperature in the tunnel.

To better accommodate the RB energy, measures of energy storage (1) and energy feedback (2) have been proposed..." 
* energy feedback system exerts three advantages:
  - high efficiency: Excessive RB energy can be directly fed back to the AC system through the RBEFS, and the traction grid energy utilization rate can be greatly improved [17,18]
  - cheaper price: energy storage system is relatively large and expensive, and is more suitable for 600 V and 750 V traction grids at present; the price of the RBEFS is also becoming cheaper with the development of high-power semiconductor IGBTs.
  - smaller space: RB energy feedback system (RBEFS) can be considered a promising application for the MLS maglev
* energy storage systems and feedback systems have been compared to avoid the over-voltages

## [A New System of Combined Propulsion and Levitation for Maglev Transportation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9124470)

"**The Inductrack system** demonstrates a high levitation efficiency since PMs require no power to produce the magnetic field and the only power loss originates from resistive losses due to currents induced in the track. The major drawback [...] requires huge and **expensive Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) magnets which account for at least 2% of the total weight of the vehicle**"

Their proposal: "combines propulsion and suspension control in a series of asymmetric double sided linear induction motors (ADSLIMs) and allows each ADSLIM to work near its maximum efficiency operating point when producing desired propulsion and levitation forces."

Results: "The results show that the regenerative levitation case with maximum levitation efficiency demonstrates the best performance with 17.5% less power requirement compared to the zero thrust operation and 7.8% less power compared to the regenerative levitation case with maximum efficiency. "
