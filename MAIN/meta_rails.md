# Meta-Rails [RAILS ON RAILS]

## Switches
1. Cart 1 is on Track 1
2. Track 2 next to Track 1
3. Cart 1 reaches switch area
4. Cart 1's top Rail 1 detaches from bottom Rail 1, and same thing happens for Rail 2
5. Rail 1 and Rail 2 converge, one in front of other
6. Cart 1 moves to Rail 2's top fully, continues vertical movement
8. Rail 1 and Rail 2 diverge, return to original tracks, back to normal

## Docking
1. Cart arrives at docking station (still on rails)
2. Electromagnetic force applied sideways to shift the perpendicular platform towards the docking area
3. New rails replace position of initial rails (that the docked cart is on top of)
4. Ongoing traffic uses new rails
5. When docked cart returns, electronagnetic force applied to shift it back in place, replacing new rails with old
