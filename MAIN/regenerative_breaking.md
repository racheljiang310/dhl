"A power regenerative brake system converts kinetic energy into electric energy
(power generation) by using electric motors as generators during braking, and then
channeling the generated power to the overhead line for use by other trains, has
been adopted. JR Tokai put power regenerative braking to practical Shinkansen use,
for the first time, with the Series 300 and has continued to use it with Series 700 and
N700 trains.
For Series 700 trains, 12 of the normal 16 carriages were equipped with the brake
system, but with the Series N700, the brake systems was extended to 14 carriages
in order to acquire all the braking force usually required for a train equipped with the
power regenerative brake system. This has further raised the energy efficiency and
contributed to reductions in Shinkansen energy consumption."
