Define: converts kinetic energy into electric energy (power generation) by using electric motors as generators during braking
- channel the generated power to the overhead line for use by other trains
- idea: run motor forward => create mech energy; run backwards => vehicle's momentum = mech energy

JR Tokai put power regenerative braking to Series 300 - Series 700 and N700 trains.
- Series 700 trains, 12 of the normal 16 carriages were equipped with the brake system
- Series N700, 14 carriages to acquire all the braking force usually required for a train
