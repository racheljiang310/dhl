# M.2 Solid State Drives
----

Define: compact, high-performance storage device commonly used in modern computing systems, including laptops, desktops, and data centers. Its small form factor and high-speed interface make it ideal for applications requiring fast **data access** and **low power consumption**

----
## M.2 Form Factor

Shape and Size: M.2 SSDs are rectangular with length (first two digits = the width in mm, last two represent the length). **They are installed directly to motherboard**

Keying: M.2 SSDs have notches (keys) on the edge connector to indicate their supported interfaces (e.g., SATA, PCIe NVMe).

Our chosen M.2: PCIe NVMe

----
## M.2 Components [1TB storage]

#### A. NAND Flash Memory [4-8 grams]
> primary storage medium where data is stored; non-volatile, 3D NAND to > storage density
- SLC, MLC, TLC, WLC
- high -> low endurance
- low -> high capacity
- - scaling up > mass, by a lot

#### B. Controller (Microcontroller) [0.5-1 gram]
> manages data storage & retrieval
- read/write operations
- error correction, wear leveling, garbage collection (invalidations, free space)
- interfaces with host system via SATA/PCIe NVMe protocols
- DRAM Cache for frequent data access & mapping tables
**Note**: ECC (Advanced Error Correction)
  - ECC usually used to ensure data integrity over long periods
  - we use it for short-term data transport, so we can just reply on the host system's error checking
  - not a huge issue bc its scalable size doesn't change much

#### C. DRAM Cache (Optional) [0.5-1 gram]
> speeds up operations
- mapping tables (FTL: Flash Translation Layer)
- buffer for read/write ops
- scaled up weight not huge

**NOTE**: Don't remove
  
#### D. Interface Connector [0.5-1 gram]
> edge connector that plugs into M.2 slot on motherboard
- electrical/data connections between SSD & host
- protocols

#### E. PCB (Printed Circuit Board) [2-4 grams]
> holds all componenents together
- electrical connections between the components above
- withstand thermal/mechanical stress
- scaling up > mass
**NOTE**: we could find a way to reduce the width/length of the PCB, potentially

#### F. Voltage Regulators [0.5-1 grams]
> regulates power supply to SSD
- 3.3V input voltage converted to required 

#### G. Thermal Solutions [1-5 grams]
> manages heat dissipation
- thermal pads, heatsinks, thermal throttling (scaling up > mass)
**Note**:
  - we could create our own heat sinks outside of the SSD, potentially at the docking stations
  - maybe we don't really need them in the SSD?

1. Removing Heatsink: saves 5-10 grams
2. Removing DRAM Cache: saves .5-1 gram (not really worth it in terms of mass) [future me: no]
3. Simplified controller: reduce power consumption/heat generation
  - removing ECC
  - removing heat sink management
  - remove cache management
4. Simplifying PCB: harder to do, but could still save a little

## Abstraction Layers

####  Way 1: Buy it [Micronâ€™s 232-layer 3D NAND](https://dmassets.micron.com/is/image/microntechnology/gcm-1019003-infographic-232l-nand-540x340px-v2?ts=1730186089519&dpr=off)
- [Info](https://www.micron.com/products/storage/nand-flash/232-layer-nand)

#### Way 2: Custom SSD firmware

1. Architecture & Interfaces
* Host Interface: PCIe (NVMe)
* NAND Interface: ONFI/Toggle NAND

2. NAND Flash Management
* Wear Leveling: balance usage of NAND cells
* Garbage Collection
* Bad Block Management: Identify/remap bad NAND blocks
* ECC (Error Correction Code): can be simple

3. [Firmware & Optimization](https://codecapsule.com/2014/02/12/coding-for-ssds-part-1-introduction-and-table-of-contents/)
* **FTL(Flash Translation Layer): Maps logical addresses to physical NAND locations**
  * software layer in an SSD controller that translates logical block addresses (LBA) from the host system into physical locations on the NAND flash memory. 
    - Logical-to-Physical Address Mapping (L2P) 
      * OS sees the SSD as a traditional block storage device, with addresses in LBA format 
      * dynamically maps these logical addresses to physical NAND locations, maintaining a mapping table 
          - Page-Level FTL: Maps each page individually to an LBA => fast random writes, need large mapping table 
          - Block-Level FTL: Maps entire blocks => < memory overhead, write amplification 
          - Hybrid FTL (Log): page-level mapping for hot data and block-level mapping for cold data. 
    - Wear Leveling 
        * limited number of P/E (Program/Erase) cycles per block 
        * writes are evenly distributed across the NAND 
    - Garbage Collection: periodically moves valid data to new locations and erases old blocks to reclaim 
    - Bad Blocks: defects are marked and avoided, redirecting data storage 
    - Error Correction Handling: correct bit errors before returning data to the host 
* DRAM Cache Management: Not needed maybe? 
* Power Loss Protection: Ensures data integrity during unexpected power cuts 

4. Hardware Design
* FPGA Prototyping: test controller on an FPGA before moving to an ASIC design
* Custom PCB: Routing high-speed NAND and PCIe signals requires careful layout design

## [PCI Express](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/pci-express.htm)
> Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI): bus is a channel or path between the components in a computer. Part of the slower bus that is responsible for communicating with hard disks and sound cards. Provides **direct access to system memory** for connected devices, but uses a **bridge to connect** to the frontside bus and, thus, to the CPU
 
- Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe):
  - Purpose: direct connection between two devices (nodes) on the bus is established while they are communicating with each other (point-to-point system)
    - better performance and scalable, enable parallel connections
    - <#>x connection: # lanes to carry data
    - AGP graphics card slots have PCI-Express 16x slots => more lanes
