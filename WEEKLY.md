Parameters for Simulation: Simulator recieves `config`
- Number of cards total
- processing time => ML model uses data
- Cart: acceleration/decceleration
- dataset size in TeraByte/PetaByte
- Number of Rails: 1 rail => constant
- SSD: max-speed, length, weight (constant)
- number ssds/card (64, etc.) => gives you weight
- Number of copies of each dataset => assume 1 for now
- Docking Station: number per node (server), time for docking/undocking period (3 seconds)

Simulation: needs a trace (collection of orders) OR Astrasim
- TIME 1: Node A: SSD3
- TIME 2: Node B: SSD25
- TIME 3: NODE B: SSD3 => conflict with TIME 1's request => will BLOCK => output for time blocked

Ouput:
- N launches
- total time it took
- time blocked

Construction:
- timer / clock
- hash / queue of when tasks are complete
- schedule, waiting, processing queues
- running queue

Raw Nand from Mac Studio: memory chips used for storage without an integrated controller
- Where: mounted directly onto the logic board
- Controller? built into Apple’s custom processor (M1/M2 SoC)
- Why?
  - allows for bypass of standard SSD form factors
  - higher bandwidth & power efficiency
  - more control over performance and thermals

SCMaglev's [implementation](https://global.jr-central.co.jp/en/company/_pdf/superconducting_maglev.pdf)

- coil made of a Niobium-titanium alloy
- electrodynamic suspension (EDS) system
- cooled down to reach superconductivity

Regenerative Breaking
- electric torque changes direction, but the velocity maintains the same orientation
- motor velocity is greater than synchronous velocity $v > v_s$
- maximal regenerated energy formula: $P_{rotor} = \frac{V^2s}{R_2}$
  - power transfer between rotor & stator
  - stator loss & flux leakage are negligible
  - $s = \frac{w_1}{w_2}$ where $w_1$ is the motor angular velocity and $w_2$ is the synchronous angular velocity
  - $V$ is voltage
  - $R_2$ is sum of the secondary resistance (due to the losses in copper, with the element that is the conversion of elec into mech energy)

## 1. **Overview of Progress**

This week progress: Happy 🥧 Day!

- pause on simulation
- updated Cart Mass Calculations spreadsheet:
  - targeting Rocket 4 Plus SSD (8TB), specific mass is really hard to find, so I estimated based on finding common density and dimensions of some parts
  - calculated estimations for power consumption and recovery via tweaking parameters
  - link to [calculations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Co3nxuuoy1GcUiEevEvnTI8xphWBnEozjH-1yfd05E/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
  - chart results [link](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/blob/main/MAIN/simulation.md)
- Studied SCMaglev vs China's Shanghai Maglev: different implementations, consider how we can boost regenerative breaking capabilities & reduce power consumption

---

## 2. **Next Steps**
For the upcoming week, I plan to:
- look into raw NAND memory like Apple Studio
- do research on SCMaglev's implementation & find ways we can boost power recovery to power usage ratio
  - consider issues that SCMaglev is currently facing: cooling, regenerative breaking, wheels-then-levitate
- expand spreadsheet such that we can find optimal parameters to maximize the power recovery to power usage ratio

Prof feedback on SSDs
- cache and control logic doesn't have to be in the carts, we can move them to servers & just keep raw flash mem in carts
- reference: Apple Studio

---

## 2. **Next Steps**
For the upcoming week, I plan to:
- Create a mapping for server to access data with the addition of inserting carts in the middle. Potentially adding to FTL or adding to existing cache
- pause on simulation, need to confirm final schema with team before continuing
- SSDs figure out how to detatch SSD controller from SSD & still have things work when server accesses data
- some calculations with respect to energy, speed, and efficiency when using a Rocket 4 Plus SSD (8TB)
