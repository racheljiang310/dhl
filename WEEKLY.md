## 1. **Overview of Progress**

This week progress: ðŸ”¥

- SSD Research and [Findings](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/blob/main/MAIN/ssds.md)
  - found cool video for learning about memory mapping, controller interfacing with SSDs
- Schema for communication between servers, carts, and metadata server lookups
  - what sends what to what and when to carry out a cart data access request
  - [Schema](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/blob/main/MAIN/communication_schemas.md)
- Regenerative Breaking: got stats! and experiment studies
  - [Main Doc](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/blob/main/PAPERS/maglev_cobra.md)

---

## 2. **Next Steps**
For the upcoming week, I plan to:
- API: work on some diagrams for this
- Simulation: Continue working on Network Switches/Docking
- More Statistics & Paper Reading

  - found cool website for learning
- Regenerative Breaking: got stats! and experiment studies
  - [Main Doc](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/blob/main/MAIN/regenerative_breaking.md)
  - [Papers](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/tree/main/PAPERS)

## 2. **Next Steps**
For the upcoming week, I plan to:
- API: how is data mapped into carts? Data mapped into ssds?
  - need data, does it know which cart to access? Mapping table?
  - distributed, parallel, threaded?
  - research how distributed datasets are used in ML models?
  -  Network Switches/Docking: simple simulation? (Unreal Engines / Unity)
  - This week: cost of supercapacitor storage system + other regenerative breaking

## 1. **Overview of Progress**
This week progress:
- Brainstorm Network Switching / Docking [More Braindump](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/blob/main/MAIN/meta_rails.md)
  - Met with Yarwin: Discussed how we could do Rails on Rails
- SSD Research and [Findings](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/blob/main/MAIN/ssds.md)
  - Potentially take off cache?
  - Remove heat sink fs (takes up a lot of weight afterall)
  - think about stacking & mapping memory to id
- Regenerative Breaking
  - [Main Doc](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/blob/main/MAIN/regenerative_breaking.md)
  - Reading papers: [Papers](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/tree/main/PAPERS)
    - Maglev-Cobra & Yamanashi Test Line have maglev regenerative breaking initiatives => need to look into specific stats on how much % energy regained

## 2. **Next Steps**
For the upcoming week, I plan to:
- [Rail on Rails]: do the math, maybe find a simulation software for it
- [Regenerative Breaking]: look into stats
- [Identify Cart]: further designing
- [SSDs]: learn more about SSDs, and figure out memory mapping if we stack them 3D

## 1. **Overview of Progress**
This week progress:
- Brainstorm Network Switching / Docking [Braindump](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1rsbkDRbqh8WbcEoA0NRzeHCZfSCtXhhv3560oUPtj4M/edit?usp=sharing)
- Met with Yarwin: Discussed network switching & card identification process
- Potential no contact data transfer?
  - Free-Space Optical Communication (FSOC): lasers to transmit data at speeds comparable to optical fiber. (Tbps) speeds over short distances.
  - Terahertz Wireless Communication: THz frequency range, enabling ultra-high-speed wireless data transfer (experimental stage)
  - Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) Wireless: (Gbps) speeds, good for real-time data streaming
- Pre-existing [Braindump Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Eglz0b-QdzZEQDLx2L2KOPlc13EjNpj-NsEMbnBi9Q/edit?tab=t.0)

## 2. **Next Steps**
For the upcoming week, I plan to:
- [Rail on Rails]: consider mass of rails, how this would work, etc
- [Regenerative Breaking]: look into
- [Identify Cart]: further designing
- [Reduce mass]: learn more about SSDs
- [Reduce power]: can DHL carts be more energy efficient?
