## 3. **Weekly Notes**
Raw Nand from Mac Studio: memory chips used for storage without an integrated controller
- Where: mounted directly onto the logic board
- Controller? built into Apple‚Äôs custom processor (M1/M2 SoC)
- Why?
  - allows for bypass of standard SSD form factors
  - higher bandwidth & power efficiency
  - more control over performance and thermals

SCMaglev's [implementation](https://global.jr-central.co.jp/en/company/_pdf/superconducting_maglev.pdf)

- coil made of a Niobium-titanium alloy
- electrodynamic suspension (EDS) system
- cooled down to reach superconductivity

Regenerative Breaking
- electric torque changes direction, but the velocity maintains the same orientation
- motor velocity is greater than synchronous velocity $v > v_s$
- maximal regenerated energy formula: $P_{rotor} = \frac{V^2s}{R_2}$
  - power transfer between rotor & stator
  - stator loss & flux leakage are negligible
  - $s = \frac{w_1}{w_2}$ where $w_1$ is the motor angular velocity and $w_2$ is the synchronous angular velocity
  - $V$ is voltage
  - $R_2$ is sum of the secondary resistance (due to the losses in copper, with the element that is the conversion of elec into mech energy)

# WINTER 2025 WEEKLY PROGRESS UPDATES

**Name:** [Rachel Jiang]  
**Research Topic:** [DHL]  
**Week:** [10]: Mar 14 ü•ß

---

## 1. **Overview of Progress**

This week progress: Happy ü•ß Day!

- pause on simulation
- updated Cart Mass Calculations spreadsheet:
  - targeting Rocket 4 Plus SSD (8TB), specific mass is really hard to find, so I estimated based on finding common density and dimensions of some parts
  - calculated estimations for power consumption and recovery via tweaking parameters
  - link to [calculations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Co3nxuuoy1GcUiEevEvnTI8xphWBnEozjH-1yfd05E/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
  - chart results [link](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/blob/main/MAIN/simulation.md)
- Studied SCMaglev vs China's Shanghai Maglev: different implementations, consider how we can boost regenerative breaking capabilities & reduce power consumption

---

## 2. **Next Steps**
For the upcoming week, I plan to:
- look into raw NAND memory like Apple Studio
- do research on SCMaglev's implementation & find ways we can boost power recovery to power usage ratio
  - consider issues that SCMaglev is currently facing: cooling, regenerative breaking, wheels-then-levitate
- expand spreadsheet such that we can find optimal parameters to maximize the power recovery to power usage ratio

## 1. **Overview of Progress**

This week progress: üëµüèº

- continuing work on overall [simulation](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/blob/main/MAIN/simulation.md) (using Unity)
- received feedback from Prof on network switches, modified ideas & open to more feedback [link](https://github.com/racheljiang310/dhl/blob/main/MAIN/meta_rails.md)
- more research into SSDs, specifically into the datasheets and specs for a Rocket 4 Plus SSD (8TB)

Prof feedback on SSDs
- cache and control logic doesn't have to be in the carts, we can move them to servers & just keep raw flash mem in carts
- reference: Apple Studio

---

## 2. **Next Steps**
For the upcoming week, I plan to:
- Create a mapping for server to access data with the addition of inserting carts in the middle. Potentially adding to FTL or adding to existing cache
- pause on simulation, need to confirm final schema with team before continuing
- SSDs figure out how to detatch SSD controller from SSD & still have things work when server accesses data
- some calculations with respect to energy, speed, and efficiency when using a Rocket 4 Plus SSD (8TB)
