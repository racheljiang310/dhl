## 1. **Overview of Progress**
This week progress:
- Brainstorm Network Switching / Docking [Braindump](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1rsbkDRbqh8WbcEoA0NRzeHCZfSCtXhhv3560oUPtj4M/edit?usp=sharing)
- Met with Yarwin: Discussed network switching & card identification process
- Potential no contact data transfer?
  - Free-Space Optical Communication (FSOC): lasers to transmit data at speeds comparable to optical fiber. (Tbps) speeds over short distances.
  - Terahertz Wireless Communication: THz frequency range, enabling ultra-high-speed wireless data transfer (experimental stage)
  - Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) Wireless: (Gbps) speeds, good for real-time data streaming
- Pre-existing [Braindump Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Eglz0b-QdzZEQDLx2L2KOPlc13EjNpj-NsEMbnBi9Q/edit?tab=t.0)

## 2. **Next Steps**
For the upcoming week, I plan to:
- [Rail on Rails]: consider mass of rails, how this would work, etc
- [Regenerative Breaking]: look into
- [Identify Cart]: further designing
- [Reduce mass]: learn more about SSDs
- [Reduce power]: can DHL carts be more energy efficient?
